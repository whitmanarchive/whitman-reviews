         <head type="main-authorial">"A Pleasant Quiz" <!-- [Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)] --> </head>

         <p>Under the title "Walt Whitman and his Poems," the <hi rend="italic">United States Review</hi> recently published the
    following article. We take it to be a smart satire upon the present tendency of authors to run into rhapsody and transcendentalism; and therefore its main fault in a literary point of view—that it suggests the notice of a man reviewing his own work—is not of much importance.<ref target="n1" n="1" xml:id="r1"/>

            <p>

               <note type="editorial" target="r1" xml:id="n1" n="1">This introductory paragraph is followed by a reprint of one of Whitman's own reviews of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Whitman's review, "Walt Whitman and His Poems," was first published in the <hi rend="italic">United States Review</hi> in September, 1855. Strictly speaking, then, the excerpt from "A Pleasant Quiz" given above is not a review itself, but rather a comment on a previous review. We reproduce the comment here because of the light it sheds on Whitman's contemporary reception and on his practice of reviewing himself. The poet's self-reviewing was detected right from the start, possibly as he himself wanted it to be.</note>
