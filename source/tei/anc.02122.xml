         <p>Roberts Brothers, Boston, publish, in very neat form, Walt Whitman's ridiculous rigmarole, by an extreme stretch of critical courtesy called "<hi rend="italic">American Institute Poem</hi>."<ref target="n1" n="1" xml:id="r1"/> If it were only decent prose we might stand it; but it does not rise to the dignity of a dessertation. To show what drivel a man of some poetic talent is capable of palming off on the public, we give the opening lines:</p>

            <p> <note type="editorial" target="r1" xml:id="n1" n="1">The review misidentifies the title of this work. While the words "Walt Whitman's American Institute Poem" appear on both the volume's cover and one of its two title pages, the words are a secondary title or sub-title; the work's main title, and the one that appears most prominently on the cover, is <hi rend="italic">After All, Not to Create Only</hi>. Whitman wrote the poem following a request by the Committee on Invitations of the American Institute to deliver an original poem at the opening of the Institute's 40th Annual Exhibition in New York in 1871. It first appeared concurrently in the <hi rend="italic">New York Commercial Advertiser</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New York Evening Post</hi> on September 7, 1871. It was then published as a stand-alone volume by Roberts Brothers in Boston in late 1871. It is this bound volume that is being reviewed here. Whitman would later retitle the poem "Song of the Exposition" and include it in <hi rend="italic">Two Rivulets</hi> (1876) and in the 1881-82 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>.</note></p>
