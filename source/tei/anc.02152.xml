         <head type="main-authorial">Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman. Thayer &#38; Eldridge, Boston.</head>
         
         
         <p>We are indebted to Messrs. Center &#38; Co., for a copy of this singular work. In its typographical and mechanical departments the book is a noble specimen of taste and skill. Beyond this, our laudations must cease. The first sensation that strikes the mind of the reader is bewilderment-entire bewilderment, so that one is doubtful of the sanity of the author, and in a mist as to what he meant to say. We have always deemed it a great test of literary merit when the reader arises from the perusal of a volume, with a clearer knowledge, a more expanded view, and some substantial thread of ideas to work out by thought, upon the matter in question. But when an author perplexes brains by productions such as this, where you are obliged to seek for an intelligible idea like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay, and then cannot be certain that you have obtained that intended by the author, after suggesting a few hundred others seemingly equally applicable to the wording, he would be more useful to his fellow men, if he were to substitute the plough for the pen. It needs a interpreter to enable one to comprehend this book. One may as well read Sanerit or Oweejai. Its egotism is painful, its boldness disgusting, its arrangement absurd, and its professed poetry (?) the baldness of prose, its whole tenor a mysterious mockery,- yet a certain attractive quaintness is relied upon to atone for its many faults, ans a peculiar plainness of language to make it acceptable to erratic minds defiant of the customary decency that binds even a dictionary. If such be “America’s first distinctive poem” we tremble for the second. At some future time we may take occasion to allude to the work again. </p>
