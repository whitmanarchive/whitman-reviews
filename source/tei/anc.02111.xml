            <head type="main-authorial">Literary Nonsense. <!-- [Review] --></head>
            <p>The better class of literary men affect contempt 
            for the variety of writing which is most in demand 
            among the patrons of the prosperous weeklies and 
            the paper-covered novels. Cobb has very little 
            credit for corn, and the alliterative names of 
            poetesses that so copiously illustrate our literature 
            are believed to have achieved the noblest immortality 
            they deserve, when conferred upon a fast 
            trotting mare, or painted upon a stern-wheel 
            steamer. It is the fashion, among certain of the 
            elect, to look with contempt upon all the reading 
            that really has a purpose in it—that feeds the life 
            of the people directly, with food honestly adapted 
            to their wants. Now it may be submitted that, to 
            a man of culture, or to a man who has seen much 
            of life, the florid style that so wins the popular eye 
            is offensive. Yet that writing has its mission. It 
            educates men to better reading. Less vivid coloring 
            and less extravagant forms would fail to attract 
            the insensitive eyes of the multitude. Once 
            attracted and once fastened, they learn to detect 
            the true among the false, and grow into likelier 
            likings and juster judgments.</p>
            
            <p>But the real nonsense of literature is not written 
            for the people; it is written for men of culture by 
            men of culture. The most insignificant stuff that 
            ever was uttered has made its appearance in first 
            class journals, and, by its position, claimed for itself 
            consideration and admiration. "Brahma" will 
            be recalled as a poem that was issued in the first 
            number of the Atlantic Monthly. It was stared 
            at, talked about, travestied, paraphrased, parodied, 
            admired, ridiculed, stuffed, and treated with the 
            most flattering consideration. Why? Because it 
            appeared in a first class magazine, and was said 
            to have been written by a first class man. Was 
            there anything in it? Did ever a man get one 
            idea out of it? Had it a mission in the world of 
            mind? Nothing of the kind. It was an imposition 
            upon the good sense of the public. Every 
            man who threw down the poem after his unsatisfactory 
            perusal of it, with the thought that there 
            was a profound idea in it that he could not comprehend, 
            was cheated and injured by it. It is 
            wrong to thrust such unmeaning twaddle before 
            the eyes of a public, earnestly seeking for a true 
            culture,—to impress that public with the thought 
            that there is wisdom in it, and that they are fools if 
            they fail to find it. There is no medium like a 
            very respectable magazine with very respectable 
            contributors for transmuting inconsequential nonsense 
            into incomprehensible sense.</p>
            
            <p>But we had nearly forgotten "Brahma," and 
            were only reminded of it by the appearance in the 
            last number of the Atlantic of a string of nonsense 
            for which one Walt. Whitman is responsible before 
            the fact of publication. This poem is called 
            "Bardic Symbols," if poem that may be which 
            has neither rhythm nor rhyme. Walt. Whitman 
            stands on the shore of Ocean, and says:—</p>

            character of the writer, and his desires and 
            intentions concerning the reader. This is his first 
            effort at "impressing others":—</p>

            <p>The stanza that follows this exhibition of the 
            most extraordinary and unjustifiable conduct on 
            the part of the "real me" is full of pathos, and 
            quite as full of truth:—</p>

            <p>Reader, the Atlantic Monthly, the best of American 
            magazines, publishes two pages and a half of 
            this stuff, and for what? For its literary merit?—it is a chaos of unmeaning words and a wilderness 
            of bad grammar. For its thought? 
            There is not a well-defined thought in it. 
            For any hint of "bardic symbols?" There 
            is not a new one in it. The whole performance 
            is execrable—a mass of half-crazy, half-idiotic 
            nonsense, and, considered as a literary production, 
            is a disgrace to the journal which gave it 
            birth. If this production had appeared, word for 
            word, in some modest country paper, it would 
            had been seized upon at once by the press as a 
            theme for immeasurable fun, like Mr. Tenney's immortal 
            Fourth of July Oration. Yet, because 
            some philosopher of the accepted stamp has indorsed 
            the writer of this, and it has appeared in a 
            magazine presided over by an excellent mind, it 
            becomes respectable, and is blindly supposed to 
            have excellencies, could they only be detected and 
            measured.</p>
            
            <p>There is something in the slang phrase "good 
            horse sense" which we like. It is a kind of sense 
            which discards this whole class of productions—the mystical, the affectedly homely, the dreamily 
            rhapsodical, the enigmatical—as things of no 
            value, when, by the circumstances which accompany 
            them, they fail to be things of mischief. 
            They belong to the realm of nothings, and every 
            healthy man and woman who has to do with 
            things will despise them, and wonder how Maga 
            can tolerate them for a moment.</p>
