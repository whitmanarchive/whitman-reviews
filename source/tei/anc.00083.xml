         <p>Walt Whitman has issued a new and complete edition of his poems, with the same title as that given to his first volume, published in 1855, and reissued at Camden, N. J., some twenty years later. In his volume all the objectionable passages which were the cause of so much complaint at the time of their first appearance are given entire without a word changed or omitted. It was said of Mr. Mallock<ref target="n1" xml:id="r1" n="1"/> by an English reviewer, that in his last novel he had introduced "the beastly into literature." Considering some of the unexpurgated lines in this volume, Mr. Whitman is entitled to the honorable position of the apostle of the beastly in poetry. Nothing that Swinburne—a kindred unclean spirit, of greater intellectual power, however—ever wrote compares with the foulness of some of the "good gray poet's" verse. The lines might be appropriate over the portals of a bawdy house, but not in a volume of poetry from a respectable publishing firm, intended for general circulation.</p> 

         <p>Mr. Whitman has been so long silent that the leading facts in his career are generally forgotten. He is now in his 63d year, having been born in 1819 at West Hills, on Long Island. His father was an Englishman and his mother from Holland. During his life he has worked as printer, carpenter, school-teacher, army-nurse, and clerk in the office of the Attorney-General. He has traveled quite extensively, and has suffered of late years from partial paralysis. For a proper appreciation of his poetry a peculiarly cultured taste is required. Claiming to be a writer for and of the people, those to whom Whitman appeals have shown the least sympathy with him and the greatest ignorance of the inspirations of his muse. Possibly we do not comprehend Whitman. Certainly we fail to enjoy what he is pleased to call his poetry. To any of Carlyle's heavily-capitalized pages the same title might be applied with equal force. The difficulty is to understand why it would not be equally effective and striking if entitled "prose." Take as an instance the poem entitled "Our Old Feuillage":</p>

         <p>Thus, in the same strain, this so-called poetry runs on for four pages without a single period! It is true that Walt Whitman has been praised by such high authorities in literature as Emerson, Tennyson, and Ruskin. Their eulogies, however, were rather on the thoughts and sentiments of the author than praise of his versification. His power is rugged and his controlling impulse, apart from his egotism, is to say whatever occurs to him at the moment, whether relevant or irrelevant. He lacks both rhyme and rhythm. His is imaginative, but not metrical, composition; the fruit of an excited imagination, but without measured form. If we call him a great poet, and judge him by his writings, where shall we assign our Longfellow or Whittier, tried on the same kind of evidence? Macaulay<ref target="n2" xml:id="r2" n="2"/> has as broad and liberal a definition of ars poetica as anyone. "By poetry," he says, "we mean the art of employing words in such a manner as to produce an illusion on the imagination; the art of doing by means of words what the painter does by means of colors." Now, if we take one or two of Walt Whitman's best efforts, how does he fulfill these requirements? Here is a little bit called "Aboard at a Ship's Helm":</p>

         <p>Milton defines poetry as "thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers"; and Chatfield says, "Poetry is the music of thought, conveyed to us in the music of language." Joubert happily puts it, "Nothing which does not transport is poetry. The lyre is a winged instrument." Let us see, then how a few lines from Whitman's "Song of Myself" come up to the requirements of these authorities:</p>

         <p>Ruskin considers that "It is a shallow criticism that would define poetry as confined to literary productions in rhyme and metre. The written poem is only poetry <hi rend="italic">talking</hi>, and the statue, the picture, and the musical composition are poetry <hi rend="italic">acting</hi>. Milton and Goethe, at their desks, were not more truly poets than Phidias<ref target="n3" xml:id="r3" n="3"/> with his chisel, Raphael at his easel, or deaf Beethoven bending over his piano, inventing and producing strains which he himself could never hope to hear"—and this great critic, Ruskin,<ref target="n4" xml:id="r4" n="4"/> say Whitman's admirers, has praised our hero! So be it! Phidias and Raphael and Beethoven were judged in accordance with the merits of what they produced. Their "<hi rend="italic">acted</hi> poetry" stood the test of the most acute analysis and was given prominent rank because it was perfection. In the same manner "<hi rend="italic">talking</hi> poetry," by whoever written, must satisfy the eye, the ear, the mind, the heart, all the higher mental faculties in order to be classed as true, genuine inspired poetry. Does this short poem meet these demands:</p>

         <p>There is no thought of melody, of the mechanical requirements of verse. It is simply a combination of words like unto the bits of glass in the child's kaleidoscope. Is it the language of a real genius or the voice of a ponderous fool? Whitman himself partially answers the question in a song from which we have already quoted. He is:</p>

         <p>This is the pen picture of himself by the man claiming to be the apostle of a new art, instead of being really the apostle of a great art in its most degraded form. 
There is no necessity for further quotation. We can admire the native, rugged strength of Whitman's unhampered genius. His active, brilliant imagination and his far-reaching enthusiasm seeking expression in language—in words that shall fire the heart and excite the mind—are characteristics of an extraordinary nature. So too his command of language and, apparently inexhaustible vocabulary is remarkable in a man with such antecedents and personal history. But these qualities do not make him a great poet. And to rank him as such is, to our thinking, to establish an entirely new standard from that which we have been wont to apply to the great masters of song. If they are true poets, then is Whitman a false one; if he is a poetic genius, then were the most honored names of literature but poetasters and "pitiful rhymers." </p>
