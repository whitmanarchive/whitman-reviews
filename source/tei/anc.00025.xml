         <p>[ . . .] We<ref target="n1" xml:id="r1" n="1"/> have still said nothing of Mr. Ernest Jones&#x92;s war strains; of a new poem by the American poet, Mr. Buchanan Reade<ref target="n2" xml:id="r2">∗</ref>—a gracefully rhymed, imaginative story; or of another American production which, according to some Transatlantic critics, is to initiate a new school of poetry. This is a poem called "Leaves of Grass,"<ref target="n3" xml:id="r3">†</ref> and, instead of criticizing it, we will give a short extract, typical in every respect, except that it contains none of the very bold expressions by which the author indicates his contempt for the &#x93;prejudices&#x94; of decency.</p>
