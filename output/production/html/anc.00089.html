         <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">"THE POETRY OF THE FUTURE." </h4>

         <p class="tei_p">Here we have it, the real Simon-pure article,<a href="n2" class="internal_link"/> and no doubt about it.<a href="n1" class="internal_link">∗</a> At least we are so assured by the author and by his admirers. Let us see wherein the poetry of the future differs from the poetry of the past and the present, and whether it can make good its title to be considered the poetry of the future.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman is a great poet—in his own estimation, and in that of critics who make up in noise what they lack in numbers. This volume is intended to demonstrate to the world that his claim is well-founded; for, like other great men who have an original message to deliver to the world, he has been misunderstood. He should not complain, however, but remember that obloquy is the ordinary lot of genius. This volume, we repeat, is intended to be his vindication. We have read it carefully and curiously-curiously, because though we had heard much of Whitman before, we confess to dense ignorance of all but a hundred lines or so of his writings—and we do not hesitate to say that it is a volume admirably calculated to convince those who were previously of his opinion. That it will convince others we—but this is to pass judgment before the cause is argued.</p>

            <h3 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial tei_head_rend_center">His Moral Tone.</h3>

            <p class="tei_p">We should not be true to our own convictions if we neglected to protest, on the very threshold of the subject, against the coarse filthiness of the book. The author is by turns blasphemous and obscene, for the mere sake of showing that he dare do anything and say anything that he chooses. We are not sure that the book is not amenable to the laws against sending obscene literature through the mails; and were the Society for the Suppression of Vice to test the matter, any ordinary jury would give a verdict in its favor. The plea that the book is "literature" does not excuse such unmitigated and indefensible nastiness as disfigures some of its pages. Byron and Swinburne and Oscar Wilde are as modest as a young maiden by comparison. To write such a book and send it forth to the world with a complacent smirk required great courage—or brazen effrontery—on the part of its author; and it is strange that he should have obtained the imprint for it of so respectable a publishing house. <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible">[illegible]</span>

            <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman's artistic creed is easily understood. He states it on the very first page of this volume:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Decline? He jumps at the chance, and wallows in vice and crime at every opportunity. The poet's friends tell us that his life has been correct, that only in his verse is he a libertine; so much the worse for him, he cannot even plead in extenuation of his offence that he had become so accustomed to evil that it is second nature to him. Deliberate baseness is always worse than the baseness that is the outcome of a depraved and bestial nature.</p>

         <div class="ancillary">
            <h3 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial tei_head_rend_center">Is Walt Whitman a Poet?</h3>

            <p class="tei_p">No one will dispute Byron's place in the temple of fame, however severely he may condemn the poet's character and the impress it has left on his work. Walt Whitman may be a poet in spite of his immorality. He asks us to accept him as a poet, as a great poet, with a bold egotism which must be either the height of sublimity or the height of folly. Is he a poet?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">That depends, of course, on what one means by poetry. If by poetry we mean verse composed according to regular rhythmical laws, with or without rhyme, Walt Whitman is not a poet. Regular he never is; rhythmical he is at times, but in a wild and irregular way; and of rhyme he is very sparing, for the most part avoiding it altogether. If there are in this volume six consecutive lines to be found anywhere that will "scan" perfectly according to any one known metre, it may safely be assumed that they exist wholly by accident, not by the poet's design. He simply happened to express himself in that way. But we do not believe that six such lines are to be found; we have looked diligently, and have not discovered them. To return: if poetry be admitted to be, as to its essence, independent of mere form; if irregular, capricious and rugged rhythmical forms be conceded fittingly to embody poetical thought and constitute a different thing from merely poetical prose; then it will be hard to deny that Walt Whitman is, at infrequent intervals, a true poet. That he is a great poet is a preposterous claim, that is not worth the trouble of serious refutation.</p>

The Psalms are commonly called poetry, yet they have neither rhyme nor regular rhythm; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Beowulf</span> is called poetry, yet it has nothing to distinguish it from prose but a sort of alliteration. If it be admitted that the above are poetry—of a genuine, though perhaps not of the most perfect, sort—Walt Whitman's claim to be a poet is, perhaps, borne out, but his claim to be an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">original</span> poet is made ridiculous. At the best he has done ill what David did well over three thousand years ago. But admitting that the Psalms are poetry, can we deny the same title to these lines?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">On the other hand, while one is wading through the unnumbered lines of dreary trash in this volume, how often is he tempted to declare that Walt Whitman has not the poet's gift in the slightest measure—that he is only an ignorant American youth whose culture has been gained wholly from the street-corner and the daily newspaper, who has been smitten with a desire for notoriety, and has shrewdly determined that to be odd and singular is the shortest cut to that end. In what respect do his writhings and contortions, his twistings and turnings of our good old English tongue, differ from the affected attitudes and "intense" dialect of the "consummately utter" æsthete who gives us so much sport today? After all, does the ability to write a few fine lines constitute one a poet? Does one kernel of wheat in a bushel of chaff warrant us in giving the name "grain" to the whole? Evidently not, but evidently also, the single kernel of wheat <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">is</span> wheat in spite of the vast preponderance of chaff. May the question not be answered somewhat like this: Walt Whitman is a poet, after a fashion, but he has written very little poetry. If he is not of those who "die with all their music in them," as Dr. Holmes sings, he yet may have succeeded in uttering but a small part of the music that is in him. For noise, be it remembered, is not music.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">One further characteristic needs to be touched on in forming a complete and final judgment of the value of Whitman's work. He shows an aptness now and then for coining those</p>

            <p class="tei_p">What could be better, for example, than his description of the sound of the carpenter's plane, as it "whistles its wild ascending lisp"? Anybody who has ever heard the sound will appreciate the striking fitness of the phrase. "Far-sprinkled systems" is a most happy epithet for the clear sky of a winter's night; and nothing could better picture in words the thronged thoroughfares of New York than this line:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">What poet has apostrophized Death more happily than this: "Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet"? And in all the poetry written about the death of President Garfield, has there been a single phrase so peculiarly happy as "the sobbing of the bells…those heartbeats of a Nation in the night"? But if one shall say of these things, One swallow does not make a summer, nor do a few happy turns of phrase make a poet—for our part we could only assent.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But, it may be asked, does Walt Whitman never submit to the trammels of poetry, as poetry is ordinarily conceived? Never fully, yet once he comes very near to doing so—in a poem on the death of Lincoln—and this is the result:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The most prejudiced will not deny that that is poetry, but Walt Whitman is not half so proud of it himself as he is of some of his "barbaric yawps." Nevertheless, he will be known fifty years hence—if he is known then at all, which we more than half-doubt—only as the author of "My Captain," on the whole, probably, the most stirring lyric that the civil war produced.

            <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman is the peculiar product of a peculiar condition of things. He is the "Bowery Bhoy" in literature, a rowdy with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cacoethes scribendi</span> (in plain English, the itch for writing). He could not have been bred anywhere but in a certain part of New York city a generation ago—in any other place or at another time he could no more have been developed than Plymouth Rocks can be hatched out of cobble-stones. And American letters were in a peculiar transition state when he made his first appearance in print, which fact alone made his career possible. A few devoted admirers have diligently puffed him, and the more judicious critics have ridiculed him into a sort of fame. It is a common saying among publishers that next to very warm praise of a book downright abuse on the part of the critics will best promote its sale. But a popularity thus created is always short-lived; people buy the book for a few weeks just to see whether the critics have told the truth about it, and finding that they have, toss it aside never to look at it again.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman has certain artistic virtues, it is true; he can paint a pretty pen-picture of nature as it presents itself to the eye, but he has no word for us of "the still, sad music of humanity" heard throughout nature. How can he tell us what he has never seen—what he has no eyes to see? He has a certain rough power, an aboriginal gift, so to speak, of poetic language, but he is uncouth and barbaric. He has fire, but it destroys oftener than it warms. Though he affects to be as broad as the universe, he is narrow—he has but one note to his pipe, and that a cracked one. Pathos is an element of his power, but it must be allowed that bathos is much more frequent in his writings. As Landor<a href="n3" class="internal_link"/> said of Byron, "there are things in him as strong as poison and original as sin." He is, after all, too many-sided to be characterized in a single phrase—many-sided in good qualities as well as in evil: At one time he is a dithyrambic Emerson calmly philosophizing on the spiritual truths of the universe; at another he is a prose Swinburne run mad. He is a wicked Tupper;<a href="n4" class="internal_link"/> he is an obscene Ossian;<a href="n5" class="internal_link"/> he is a poetical Zola; he is—Walt Whitman.</p>
