         <p class="tei_p">[ . . .] We<a href="n1" class="internal_link"/> have still said nothing of Mr. Ernest Jones&#x92;s war strains; of a new poem by the American poet, Mr. Buchanan Reade<a href="n2" class="internal_link">∗</a>—a gracefully rhymed, imaginative story; or of another American production which, according to some Transatlantic critics, is to initiate a new school of poetry. This is a poem called "Leaves of Grass,"<a href="n3" class="internal_link">†</a> and, instead of criticizing it, we will give a short extract, typical in every respect, except that it contains none of the very bold expressions by which the author indicates his contempt for the &#x93;prejudices&#x94; of decency.</p>
