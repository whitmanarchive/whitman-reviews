         <p class="tei_p">I<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">T</span> is fortunate that "Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps," unlike his "Leaves of Grass," is in point of propriety unexceptionable, so that it can be judged on its intrinsic merits.</p> 
  
         <p class="tei_p">The pieces of which "Drum-Taps" consists are in form, like those in "Leaves of Grass," neither blank verse nor rhythmical prose. A poet of genuine artistic power would suffer from the absence of those restraints which are to genius what its banks are to a river,—limitations that aid in the development of beauty and of force; and Mr. Whitman is so far from being an artist, that he boasts of his lack of culture, after the fashion of "self-made" men. Yet it is precisely this deficiency which disguises his real excellence, and stands between him and the fame he predicts for himself. A writer whose works are to live must have taste to discriminate between what is worth saying in a given poem, and what is not worth saying, and must have courage to excise the latter. The business of cataloguing the works of creation should be left to the auctioneer.</p> 
  
         <p class="tei_p">Poets of vastly more genius and culture than Mr. Whitman possesses have committed the error of thinking all objects and fancies equally worthy of a poem. Wordsworth, for example, patched his shining robes with homespun; but Wordsworth had the manners and speech of a gentleman, while Whitman has the characteristics, good and bad, of a Bowery boy. His love of New York City has more in common with Gavroche's<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a> love for Paris than with that of Victor Hugo, and more in common with Tony Weller's<a href="#n2"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r2">2</sup></a> love for London than with that of Dr. Johnson, Lamb, or even Dickens. His glorification of America smacks of the "We can lick all creation" of Tammany Hall.<a href="#n3"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r3">3</sup></a> But with the extravagance, coarseness, and general "loudness" of Bowery boys<a href="#n4"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r4">4</sup></a>, Mr. Whitman possesses in an unusual degree their better traits. He is not ashamed of the body he lives in, and he calls all things by plain names. His compositions, without being sentimental or pretty, show genuine sensibility to the beauty of nature and of man. His braggart patriotism evinced its genuineness during the war.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The fact that the "songs" in Drum-Taps were written under such circumstances ought to have rebutted in the most fastidious minds whatever presumption may have been raised against the volume by previous publications.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">But the claims of these productions to consideration rest upon a more solid basis than the author's personal services in the hospital. Mr. Whitman not only possesses an almost photographic accuracy of observation, a masculine directness of expression, and real tenderness of feeling, but he sometimes hits upon an original epithet which illuminates a page of prosaic details. He speaks of "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sturdy</span> artillery…soon, unlimbered to begin the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">red business</span>"; "the hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">robust</span> year" (1861); the "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hinged</span> knees and steady hand" of the dresser of wounds; the "elderly (sick) man, so gaunt and grim, with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">well-grayed hair and flesh all sunken about the eyes"; "million-footed, superb-faced</span> Manhattan"; "the wind with girlish laughter"; the "gentle, soft-born, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">measureless</span> light"; "the gorgeous, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">indolent</span>, sinking sun, burning, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">expanding</span> the air"; "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">most excellent</span> sun, so calm and haughty"; "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">huge</span> and thoughtful night." And in at least three places he shows more sustained, if not higher power. The effect of the news from Sumter<a href="#n5"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r5">5</sup></a> upon New York is thus described:—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">But Mr. Whitman's faculty is, perhaps, most fully shown in the poem entitled, "When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloomed"; in which the contrast of the beauty and life of the opening spring with the scenes presented and the thoughts awakened by the funeral of Abraham  Lincoln is drawn with unexpected power. The poem is, as a whole, remarkable, but we must content ourselves with a brief quotation.</p>
