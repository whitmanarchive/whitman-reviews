         <p class="tei_p">To ninety-nine out of every hundred educated English readers, if not, indeed, to a larger proportion, the name Walt Whitman conveys no meaning or associations whatever. Of the few, moreover, who have previously heard the name still fewer have had the opportunity of seeing the work to which it owes whatever celebrity it may have attained. Yet its bearer is a man of some mark in America, and his work has not only startled the few educated Englishmen who have seen it, but is undoubtedly destined to hold a prominent position in American literature. Many causes contribute to render <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, as Walt Whitman's principal work is called, a sealed book to English readers. The first reason is its costliness. A dozen copies would scarcely, we should suppose, reward the most diligent search that could be instituted through England, and, probably, not a quarter of that number is on sale. When met with at the establishments of the principal American bookselling agents, the price of the volume is as much as is asked for the complete works of Tennyson or Swinburne. A second reason for the scarcity of the book is that the form of its composition is not at first glance attractive, and that its contents are such as cannot possibly be admitted into family reading. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, is, however, the most thoroughly national and characteristic American poem that has yet seen the light, and is a work the influence of which will yet be felt. It is a book concerning which Englishmen ought to know at least a little. For various reasons, then, among which figures prominently the difficulty in obtaining the volume, we hold we are rendering a real service to our readers in bringing under their observation a few striking features in this remarkable and most suggestive work.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">We have spoken of it as national and characteristic in the fullest sense, and so it is. An Englishman might have written ninety-nine hundredths of American poetry. Scarcely a line or stanza in Longfellow, Holmes, Bryant, Whittier, that is in the fullest sense American. The philosophical poems of Emerson have a flavour of nationality, and a very strong taste thereof pervades such comic works as the Big[e]low papers, and other similar productions. But those comic works which aim at satirising the manners and customs of every-day life are necessarily the first parts of a young nation's literature, in which local colour is observable. Before the appearance of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, no serious American work was wholly or in any wide sense national. The spirit that pervades <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> is essentially American. It is more. To use a word the author is fond of, it is Manhattanese. A resident in the capital of the Empire State alone could have produced it. The rowdyism and greed of New York life, as well as its higher qualities, pervade it. Walt Whitman is as completely a New Yorkist as Charles Lamb was a Londoner or Christopher North a Scot. Not that he is uninfluenced by preceding writers of other countries. On the contrary, his work is, to some extent, an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">olla podrida</span> of other people's thoughts, manners, and forms, but the main current belongs to New York.<a href="#n2"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r2">1</sup></a>  The philosophy and theology are decidedly American, the ethics are altogether of New York. We seem to trace half-a-dozen authors in Walt Whitman. The freedom and coarseness of his phraseology recal[l] Rabelais. In his most poetical passages he reminds us of Ossian. His philosophy has a flavour of Emerson; his constant display of independence and his peculiar habit of self-assertion, find no parallel save in George Wither; and his didactic breathings are in form, if in nothing else, at times suggestive of Tupper.<a href="#n3"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r3">2</sup></a>
         </p> 
	
         <p class="tei_p">
            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> is a volume of nearly five hundred pages, of what the author considers and calls poetry. It is divided under several heads, the most important of which are "Walt Whitman," "Chants Democratic," "Leaves of Grass" (which gives its title to the whole), "Enfans d'Adam," "Calamus," and "Messenger Leaves." All are alike in shape. Though called poems, the contents of the entire volume, one short passage in which the rhyme may be the result of accident excepted, have neither rhyme nor metre. The poems have a long rhythmic flow, which bears about the same relation to ordinary poetry that the military or mournful music of a savage tribe does to music as understood in Western Europe. The verses are of unequal length, ordinarily possessing a caesura and a strongly-marked accent on the penultimate syllable. This last quality is, however, not always observable. To quit form, however, and come to what is more important, matter, there are three pervading ideas in the volume, which may be described as the apotheosis of the flesh, the exaltation of states life, and the promotion of comradeship. To deal with these <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">seriatim</span>, in the first Whitman takes part in a natural and easily comprehensible reaction, signs of which have of late manifested themselves, against the extreme glorification of the soul at the expense of the body, which has been one of the results of Christianity.<a href="#n4"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r4">3</sup></a> Heathen teaching held soul and body of equal account, and the Greek regarding each with equal reverence, was at as much pains to cultivate the powers of the one as is the other. The belief in the equality of the body with the soul largely pervades the writings of Whitman. Next to this comes his exaltation of democracy in general, and of American democracy in particular. Lastly comes the notion of comradeship. This last we only partially understand, and are not in the least tempted to enter upon. These are the views which first recal[l] themselves upon rising from the accomplished perusal of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. A hundred other points, however, require mentioning ere we can profess to bring before the reader Walt Whitman as he really is. It is time, however, to give the reader a few quotations illustrative of the author's modes of thought. Fortunately, in so doing we give an insight into the nature of his verse also. We are obliged to be guarded in our selections. It is not possible to quote the passages which are in the fullest sense characteristic. Neither is it possible in the space we have allotted ourselves to give more than the feeblest conceivable idea of the nature of the contents of the remarkable book before us. Here are four lines in which the author describes himself:—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">But we can extract no more. Our space forbids, and, inadequately as our task is accomplished, we must retire from it. Our readers have seen enough of the book to have an idea of it and the author. To know all his talent and eccentricity is impossible till the book itself has been perused. The contents of the volume can by a stretch only be called poetry. They lack its first and most indispensable element, beauty. They are, however, strange and most suggestive reading, and such as a man of culture will not care entirely to ignore. Spite of barbarous expressions, vile Americanisms, and all faults of thought and expression, the writings of Walt Whitman are full of character, and well worthy of contemplation. They will in time attain a certain measure of celebrity even, and their author is surely entitled to a distinct niche in American literature. With this short notice we dismiss him as he dismisses himself—</p>
