            <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">The Poems of Walt Whitman</h4>

           <div class="section"> <p class="tei_p">The poems of Walt Whitman have been much praised and wondered at in this country
                since they were published here by Trübner and by Hotten, but though they are of the
                most decidedly and avowedly spiritualistic character, nobody seems to see that fact.
                They are in a singular, unrhymed style; sometimes in irregular hexameters, sometimes
                in the Ossianic metre, sometimes in that of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hiawatha</span>,
                sometimes absolutely prosaic, but always original and audaciously American. We do
                not rate him, like one of his editors here, as one of the greatest poets that ever
                lived, but he is unquestionably a great and original poet. He sets all
                conventionality at defiance. He is as free in his style, his thoughts, his
                sentiments, as the most Yankee and pretentious of his countrymen. His brag about the
                Great Republic and everything belonging to the States is of the most preposterous
                and laughable kind. His exuberance of imagery, his cataloguings of everything that
                comes in his head of every possible thing in this globe, or in the universe, is
                frequently oppressive; but amidst all this extravagance, verbiage, and tautology
                there rises a continual stream of the brightest new thoughts, the tenderest and most
                dewy sentiments and kindly human feelings, like the cool and rapid rushing of a
                mountain-born river beneath the green boughs of the forest or through the flowery
                grass of the summer meadow. The character of the philosophy of these poems, however,
                is what we desire now particularly to call attention to. It is of that advanced and
                transcendental kind which belongs only to writers who have been baptized into the
                true Jordan of Spiritualism, and have ascended from its banks into the borders of
                the Summer Land, walking there with ever-increasing wonder, and bringing thence the
                flowers and fruits of a new and eternal promise; grapes of the true vine; and golden
                gatherings from the trees of both knowledge and life. All such visitors of the world
                beyond come back with a newness of aspect, of manner, of speech, and tone of mind,
                that are unmistakable. We know them at once by the eye beaming with the light that
                shines on the mountains of the imperishable; by the joy that flushes the features of
                those who have walked and talked with the angels; by the broad spirit of sympathy
                which brings to the earth the illimitable fervour of the heavens, and sees in the
                smallest thing, in the humblest mortal, the signs of the wonder-working of the
                Infinite Spirit of creative and supporting Love. This is what we see at once in the
                poems of Walt Whitman: and he at once responds to our challenge, "Poet, thou art
                one of us!" with these words:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nor do we: Materialism is as true as Spiritualism when it is united to Spiritualism;
                it is false, or rather defective only, when it is a mere part.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But Walt Whitman sees and hears everything in the earth. The poem which he calls
                "Salut au Monde" is a long one. We have enough of it here to understand it, which
                readers at large both in America and here have not done, but have showered on the
                mediumistic poet all the epithets of "fool, madman, idiot," which the critic
                vocabulary can so plentifully furnish, with occasional praise equally extravagant.
                We have the key, and all is to us lucid as the sky and saner far than his deriders.
                How perfectly spiritual is this passage,—amongst the sights "of the deaths of
                the bodies of Gods"—Christ and others:—</p>

                and ages are open. The walls of Time, the barriers of the distant and of ages are

                from the eye of the temporal probationer, and, spirit-like, he walks cognizant amid
                the free things of the imperishable spheres. All times, people, regions, are present

            <p class="tei_p">But enough: our object is not to bring forward all the spiritual matter of the
                volume—for it is all spiritual; we want only to shew our readers that another
                spiritual poet is amongst us, whom the world accepts because it thinks him merely
                eccentric and original. The poetry of Harris is very fine, but then he said out
                plumply that the spirits of departed poets gave it him, and the wise ones turned up
                their eyes and went on. Walt Whitman does not say that any spirit gave him these
                poems, but he shews it in every line to the initiated. It is alive with that fresh,
                new, piquant, magical life that no mere poet of the world, no Browning, or
                Swinburne, or Locker has. The moment that you dip into this poetry, you feel the
                stir and heavings of the limitless ocean of the God-world of deathless powers
                beneath; you are immersed in the eternal springs and streams of primal being. The
                harmonies and airs of the Summer Land are around you. You see and hear and feel and
                know with a new rush of faculties and consciousnesses which make even the most
                surprising of material discoveries flat and poor, for they penetrate only into the
                outer surface of outer things. Here you touch the fire-springs of creative life; you
                bathe in the life fountains; you are one with the countless hosts of the wise, the
                beautiful, the loving, who have emerged from the larva cells of earth into the
                perfected zones of eternal peace and poetry. What says your poet of his state

                            <span class="tei_l">Now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, I will
                                measure myself by them;</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">And now, touched with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along
                            as those of the earth,</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">Or waiting to arrive, or passed on farther than those of the earth,</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">Thenceforth I no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to
                                arrive.</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">O I see now that life can not exhibit all to me—as the day can
                                not,</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.</span>

                        </span>
                    
                </span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Thus daily, whilst the earth porers of science pause and wonder, and then shrink from
                their own wondering, the broad day of the soul breaks more broadly; rushes on more
                peremptorily; spirits, issuing from their shy seclusion, speak out aloud, sing in
                troops and choruses to ears no longer astonished; come visibly and palpably; scatter
                over us flowers of heaven and of earth, make fire innocuous and touch disease into
                health; and poets, springing up here and there in the crowds, utter words of faith
                and vision ever and ever more startling and strong. It is high time that he that
                would have the credit of being wise should revise his wisdom, and let the mingling
                earth and heavens speak out to him of the new birth of things—new facts, new
                perceptions, new sights more wonderful than dreams, new sense of things, of justice,
                love, truth, pacification, and law—God in his world living through all in one
                perpetual and illimitable miracle.</p>

                            <span class="tei_l">That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for
                                it, and the cohering is for it!</span>
                            <span class="tei_l">And all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and
                                death are altogether for it!</span>

            <p class="tei_p">And this invincible conviction is the backbone and substance of the new dispensation
                in which the poet tells us in his preface,"From the eyesight proceeds another eyesight, and 
                from the hearing proceeds another hearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice, 
                eternally curious of the harmony of things with man."</p>
