         <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">Walt. Whitman's New Poem.</h4>

         <p class="tei_p">The author of Leaves of Grass has perpetrated another "poem." The N. Y. Saturday Press, in whose columns, we regret to say, it appears, calls it "a curious warble." Curious, it may be; but warble it is not, in any sense of that mellifluous word. It is a shade less heavy and vulgar than the Leaves of Grass, whose unmitigated badness seemed to cap the climax of poetic nuisances. But the present performance has all the emptiness, without half the grossness, of the author's former efforts. </p>

         <p class="tei_p">How in the name of all the Muses this so-called "poem" ever got into the columns of the Saturday Press, passes our poor comprehension. We had come to look upon that journal as the prince of literary weeklies, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">arbiter elegantiarum</span> of dramatic and poetic taste, into whose well filled columns nothing stupid or inferior could intrude. The numerous delicious poems; the sparkling <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bons mots</span>; the puns, juicy and classical, which almost redeemed that vicious practice, and raised it to the rank of a fine art; the crisp criticisms, and delicate dramatic humors of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Personne</span>, and the charming piquancies of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">spirituelle</span> Ada Clare<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a> - all united to make up a paper of rare excellence. And it is into this gentle garden of the Muses that that unclean cub of the wilderness, W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ALT</span> W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span>, has been suffered to intrude, trampling with his vulgar and profane hoofs among the delicate flowers which bloom there, and soiling the spotless white of its fair columns with lines of stupid and meaningless twaddle.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Perhaps our readers are blissfully ignorant of the history and achievements of Mr. Walt Whitman. Be it known, then, that he is a native and resident of Brooklyn, Long Island, born and bred in an obscurity from which it were well that he never had emerged. A person of coarse nature, and strong, rude passions, he has passed his life in cultivating, not the amenities, but the rudeness of character; and instead of tempering his native ferocity with the delicate influences of art and refined literature, he has studied to exaggerate his deformities, and to thrust into his composition all the brute force he could muster from a capacity not naturally sterile in the elements of strength. He has undertaken to be an artist, without learning the first principle of art, and has presumed to put forth "poems," without possessing a spark of the poetic faculty. He affects swagger and independence, and blurts out his vulgar impertinence under a full assurance of "originality."</p>

         <p class="tei_p">In his very first performance, this truculent tone was manifested. He exaggerated every sentiment, and piled up with endless repetition every epithet, till the reader grew weary, even to nausea, of his unmeaning rant. He announced himself to the world as a new and striking thinker, who had something to reveal. His Leaves of Grass were a revelation from the Kingdom of Nature. Thus he screams to a gaping universe:</p>

          

         <p class="tei_p">"I, Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Cosmos; I shout my voice high and clear over the waves; I send my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world." </p>

         <p class="tei_p">Such was the style of his performance, only it was disfigured by far worse sins of morality than of taste. Never, since the days of R<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ABELAIS</span>
            <a href="#n2"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r2">2</sup></a> was there such literature of uncleanness as some portions of this volume exhibited. All that is beautiful and sacred in love was dragged down to the brutal plane of animal passion, and the writer appeared to revel in language fit only for the lips of the P<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RIAPUS</span> of the old mythology.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">We had hoped that the small reception accorded to his first performance had deterred Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> from fresh trespasses in the realms of literature. Several years had passed away, his worse than worthless book had been forgotten, and we hoped that this Apollo of the Brooklyn marshes had returned to his native mud. But we grieve to say he revived last week, and although somewhat changed, changed very little for the better. We do not find so much that is offensive, but we do find a vast amount of irreclaimable drivel and inexplicable nonsense.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">We have searched this "poem" through with a serious and deliberate endeavor to find out the reason of its being written; to discover some clue to the mystery of so vast an expenditure of words. But we honestly confess our utter inability to solve the problem. It is destitute of all the elements which are commonly desiderated in poetical composition; it has neither rhythm nor melody, rhyme nor reason, metre nor sense. We do solemnly assert, that there is not to be discovered, throughout the whole performance, so much as the glimmering ghost of an idea. Here is the poem, which the author, out of his characteristic perversity, insists upon calling the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pre-verse</span>:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">This is like nothing we ever heard of in literature, unless it be the following lucid and entertaining composition:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">"Once there was an old woman went into the garden to get some cabbage to make an apple pie. Just then a great she-bear comes up and pops his head into the shop. 'What, no soap!' So he died, and she married the barber; and there was present at the wedding the Jicaninies and the Picaninies, and the Grand Panjandrum himself, with a little round button at the top; and they all fell to playing the game of catch as catch can, till the gun powder ran out of the heels of their boots."<a href="#n3"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r3">3</sup></a>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">The "poem" goes on, after the same maudlin manner, for a hundred lines or more, in which the interjection "O" is employed above five-and-thirty times, until we reach the following gem:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">There is not a doubt of it, we do assure you! And what is more, it never was anything else. Now, what earthly object can there be in writing and printing such unmixed and hopeless drivel as that? If there were any relief to the unmeaning monotony, some glimpse of fine fancy, some oasis of sense, some spark of "the vision and the faculty divine," we would not say a word. But we do protest, in the name of the sanity of the human intellect, against being invited to read such stuff as this, by its publication in the columns of a highly respectable literary journal. What is the comment of the Saturday Press itself on the "poem"? It says: </p>

         <span class="inline_quote">
            <p class="tei_p">"Like the Leaves of Grass, the purport of this wild and plaintive song, well enveloped, and eluding definition, is positive and unquestionable, like the effect of music. The piece will bear reading many times - perhaps, indeed, only comes forth, as from recesses, by many repetitions."</p>
         </span>

         <p class="tei_p">Well, Heaven help us, then, for as we are a living man, we would not read that poem "many times" for all the poetry that was ever perpetrated since the morning stars sang together. "Well enveloped, and eluding definition." Indeed! We should think so. For our part, we hope it will remain "well enveloped" till doomsday; and as for "definition," all we can do in that direction is to declare that either that "poem" is nonsense, or we are a lunatic.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">If any of the tuneful Nine have ever descended upon Mr. Walt Whitman, it must have been long before that gentleman reached the present sphere of existence. His amorphous productions clearly belong to that school which it [is] said that neither gods nor men can endure. There is no meaning discoverable in his writings, and if there were, it would most certainly not be worth the finding out. He is the laureate of the empty deep of the incomprehensible; over that immortal limbo described by Milton, he has stretched the drag-net of his genius; and as he has no precedent and no rival, so we venture to hope that he will never have an imitator.</p>
