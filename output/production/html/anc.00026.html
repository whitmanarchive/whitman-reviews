         <p class="tei_p">Well baptized: fresh, hardy, and grown for the masses. Not more welcome is their natural type to the winter-bound,bed-ridden, and spring-emancipated invalid. "Leaves of Grass" thou art unspeakably delicious,after the forced, stiff, Parnassian exotics<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a> for which our admiration has been vainly challenged.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman, the effeminate world needed thee. The timidest soul whose wings ever drooped with discouragement, could not choose but rise on thy strong pinions.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Fresh "Leaves of Grass!" not submitted by the self-reliant author to the fingering of any publisher's critic, to be arranged, rearranged and disarranged to his circumscribed liking, till they hung limp, tame, spiritless, and scentless. No. It were a spectacle worth seeing, this glorious Native American, who, when the daily labor of chisel and plane was over, him-self, with toil-hardened fingers, handled the types to print the pages which wise and good men have since delighted to endorse and to honor. Small critics, whose contracted vision could see no beauty, strength, or grace, in these "Leaves," have long ago repented that they so hastily wrote themselves down shallow by such a premature confession. Where an Emerson, and a Howitt have commended, my woman's voice of praise may not avail; but happiness was born a twin, and so I would fain share with others the unmingled delight which these "Leaves" have given me.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">I say unmingled; I am not unaware that the charge of coarseness and sensuality has been affixed to them. My moral constitution may be hopelessly tainted or—too sound to be tainted, as the critic wills, but I confess that I extract no poison from these <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>—to me they have brought only healing. Let him who can do so, shroud the eyes of the nursing babe lest it should see its mother's breast. Let him look carefully between the gilded covers of books, backed by high-sounding names, and endorsed by parson and priest, lying unrebuked upon his own family table; where the asp of sensuality lies coiled amid rhetorical flowers. Let him examine well the paper dropped weekly at his door, in which virtue and religion are rendered disgusting, save when they walk in satin slippers, or, clothed in purple and fine linen, kneel on a damask <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">"prie-dieu."</span>
         </p>

         <p class="tei_p">Sensual!—No—the moral assassin looks you not boldly in the eye by broad daylight; but Borgia-like<a href="#n2"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r2">2</sup></a> takes you treacherously by the hand, while from the glittering ring on his finger he distils through your veins the subtle and deadly poison.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Sensual? The artist who would inflame, paints you not nude Nature, but stealing Virtue's veil, with artful artlessness now conceals, now exposes, the ripe and swelling proportions.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Sensual? Let him who would affix this stigma upon <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass,</span> write upon his heart, in letters of fire, these noble words of its author:</p>
