         <p class="tei_p">Under the title "Walt Whitman and his Poems," the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">United States Review</span> recently published the
    following article. We take it to be a smart satire upon the present tendency of authors to run into rhapsody and transcendentalism; and therefore its main fault in a literary point of view—that it suggests the notice of a man reviewing his own work—is not of much importance.<a href="n1" class="internal_link"/>

               <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_target_r1 tei_note_xml:id_n1 tei_note_n_1 note" id="n1"><span>This introductory paragraph is followed by a reprint of one of Whitman's own reviews of the 1855 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman's review, "Walt Whitman and His Poems," was first published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">United States Review</span> in September, 1855. Strictly speaking, then, the excerpt from "A Pleasant Quiz" given above is not a review itself, but rather a comment on a previous review. We reproduce the comment here because of the light it sheds on Whitman's contemporary reception and on his practice of reviewing himself. The poet's self-reviewing was detected right from the start, possibly as he himself wanted it to be. </span></span>
