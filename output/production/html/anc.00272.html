         <p class="tei_p">Under the title "Walt Whitman and his Poems," the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">United States Review</span> recently published the
    following article. We take it to be a smart satire upon the present tendency of authors to run into rhapsody and transcendentalism; and therefore its main fault in a literary point of view—that it suggests the notice of a man reviewing his own work—is not of much importance.<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a>

   <hr/><div class="notes"><h3 span="notes_title">Notes</h3><p id="n1">1. This introductory paragraph is followed by a reprint of one of Whitman's own reviews of the 1855 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman's review, "Walt Whitman and His Poems," was first published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">United States Review</span> in September, 1855. Strictly speaking, then, the excerpt from "A Pleasant Quiz" given above is not a review itself, but rather a comment on a previous review. We reproduce the comment here because of the light it sheds on Whitman's contemporary reception and on his practice of reviewing himself. The poet's self-reviewing was detected right from the start, possibly as he himself wanted it to be. [<a href="#ref_r1">back</a>]</p>
