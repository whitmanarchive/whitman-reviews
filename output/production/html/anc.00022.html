         <p class="tei_p">We have received a volume, bound in green, and bearing the above title, under rather singular circumstances.  Not only does the donor send us the book, but he favours us with hints—pretty broad hints—towards a favourable review of it.  He has pasted in the first page a number of notices extracted with the scissors from American newspapers, and all magnificently eulogistic of Leaves of Grass.  So original a proceeding merits an exceptional course; and therefore we shall confine ourselves to laying before our readers, first, the opinions of the American reviewers, and next giving specimens of the work reviewed.  The relation of the two classes of extracts is curiously illustrative of contemporary American criticism.</p>

I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.  I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy.  It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the temperament, were making our Western wits fat and mean.</p>

                     <p class="tei_p">I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be.  I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p>

I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty.  It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p>

Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from taint from top to toe, free for ever from headache and dyspepsia, full-blooded, six feet high, a good feeder, never once using medicine, drinking water only—a swimmer in the river or bay or by the seashore—of straight attitude and slow movement on foot—an indescribable style evincing indifference and disdain—ample limbed, weight a hundred and eighty-five pounds, age thirty-six years [1855]—never dressed in black, always dressed freely and clean in strong clothes, neck open, shirt collar flat and broad, countenance of swarthy transparent red, beard short and well mottled with white, hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked—face not refined or intellectual, but calm and wholesome—a face of an unaffected animal—a face that absorbs the sunshine and meets savage or gentleman on equal terms.</p>

                     <p class="tei_p">The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred Tennyson.  He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy, and their combination into love.  This love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare the same as the rest.  It is possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and goods of life in their proper positions.  It seeks nature for sickly uses.  It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connexion with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female…</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Not a borrower from other lands, but a prodigal user of his own land is Walt Whitman.  Not the refined life of the drawing-room—not dancing, and polish, and gentility, but some powerful uneducated person, and some harsh identity of sound, and all wild free forms, are grateful to him.  A thrill of his own likeness strikes him as the spotted hawk wheels noisily near his head at nightfall, and he is fain to say,—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">United States Review</span> discovers in Mr. Whitman the founder of an indigenous school of American poetry:—</p>

         <span class="inline_quote">
            <span class="tei_floatingText">
               
                  <div class="extract">
                     <p class="tei_p">Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all the attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature, talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such a being as a writer.  Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior.  Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of the old theories and forms.  Every phrase announces new laws; not once do his lips unclose except in conformity with them.  With light and rapid touch he first indicates in prose the principles of the foundation of a race of poets so deeply to spring from the American people, and become ingrained through them, that their Presidents shall not be the common referees so much as that great race of poets shall.  He proceeds himself to exemplify this new school, and set models for their expression and range of subjects.  He makes audacious and native use of his own body and soul.  He must recreate poetry with the elements always at hand.  He must inbue it with himself as he is, disorderly, fleshy, and sensual, a lover of things, yet a lover of men and women above the whole of the other objects of the universe. His work is to be achieved by unusual methods.  Neither classic nor romantic is he, nor a materialist any more than a spiritualist. Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk and rhyme of poetry—not the first recognition of gods or goddesses, or Greece or Rome.  No breath of Europe, or her monarchies or priestly conventions, or her notions of gentlemen and ladies founded on the idea of caste, seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs.  But in their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age, and the realities of this mighty continent, and the sciences, and inventions, and discoveries of the present world.  Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor phrenology,  nor engineering, is more true to itself than Walt Whitman is true to them.  They and the other sciences underlie his whole superstructure.  In the beauty of the work of the poet, he affirms, are the tuft and final applause of science.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">After poetry like this, and criticism like this, it seems strange that we cannot recommend the book to our readers' perusal.  But the truth is, that after every five or six pages of matter such as we have quoted, Mr. Whitman suddenly becomes exceedingly intelligible, but exceedingly obscene.  If the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> should come into anybody's possession, our advice is to throw them instantly behind the fire.</p>
