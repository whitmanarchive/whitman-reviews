         <p class="tei_p">Five years ago a new poet appeared, styling himself the representative of America, the mouthpiece of free institutions, the personification of all that men had waited for. His writings were neither poetry nor prose, but a curious medley, a mixture of quaint utterances and gross indecencies, a remarkable compound of fine thoughts and sentiment of the pot-house. It was not an easy task to winnow the chaff from the wheat, the tares came up in such heavy luxuriance that they stunted the chance kernels of the grain, and nothing but the most vigorous of threshing was adequate to the elimination of one pure thought. That first edition of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was the earliest appearance of Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ALT</span>. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> as an author. For a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">debutant</span>, he was sufficiently egotistic and assuming. He announced, with a degree of confidence which could only have been the natural result of unparalleled self-conceit, that his mission lay in the reformation of the public taste, that the American people were to be enlightened and civilized and cultivated up to the proper standard, by virtue of his superior endowments, and that, being "a Kosmos," and inclined to "loafe" at his ease, and "invite his soul," he could afford to wait for the public's warm appreciation of his self-sacrifice, and to recline in a comfortable attitude until the world saw fit to come round to him. Two years after the publication of the first thin and unprepossessing volume of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>, a larger edition appeared, and that again is followed by a third and still more pretentious book, the present issue from the Boston house of T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HAYER</span> &amp; E<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">LDRIDGE</span>.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> has added to this volume a large collection of his writings which have never been given to the public. If possible, he is more reckless and vulgar than in his two former publications. He seems to delight in the contemplation of scenes that ordinary men do not love, or which they are content to regard as irremediable evils, about which it is needless to repine. Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> sees nothing vulgar in that which is commonly regarded as the grossest obscenity; rejects the laws of conventionality so completely as to become repulsive; gloats over coarse images with the gusto of a R<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ABELAIS</span>,<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a> but lacks the genius or the grace of R<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ABELAIS</span> to vivify or adorn that which, when said at all, should be said as delicately as possible.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Yet it would be unjust to deny the evidences of remarkable power which are presented in this work. In his hearty human sympathy, his wonderful intensity, his fullness of epithet, the author shows that he is a man of strong passion, vigorous in thought and earnest in purpose. He is uncultured, rude, defiant and arrogant, but these are faults of his nature which have not been tempered by severe training. Occasionally, a gleam of the true poetic fire shines out of the mass of his rubbish, and there are tender and beautiful touches in the midst of his most objectionable and disagreeable writings. A rough diamond, much in need of cutting and grinding and polishing, he has great intrinsic worth, but the impurities which cling about him must keep him out of the refined company he desires to enter. To be an agent for the civilization of men, he must first himself become civilized. He can do no manner of good by throwing filth, even though a handful of pure gold be sometimes mingled with a cast from his moral cesspool.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Nearly two hundred poems, of all sizes and qualities, are contained in this edition. Two dozens of these are properly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, grouped under that title, and mainly published in former editions. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chants Democratic and Native American</span> comprise twenty- one curious specimens of composition, which are neither metrical nor harmonious. Fifteen others are collected under the comprehensive heading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Enfans d'Adam</span>, and are humanitary. Fifteen others are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Messenger Leaves</span>. Four hundred and fifty pages of these productions establish the industry of the writer; and the fact that a respectable house has undertaken their publication, illustrates a lively faith in the eagerness of the public for the reception of novelties.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Some of the finer passages in this intricate maze of incongruous materials occur in the first hundred pages. Take the following weird conceit:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Again, he studies faces, and draws sharply-lined portraits:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Yet the tendency to fall into the vulgar, apparently ineradicable in Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN'S</span> composition, leads him to interlard with these such expressions as "abject louse, asking leave to be"—"milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to its hole"—"dog's snout, sniffing for garbage." He will be gross, and there is no help for it.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The egotism of the book is amusing. Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> is not only "a man-myself, typical before all," but he is "a man thirty-six years old in the year 79 of America, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">and is here anyhow</span>"—but, being here, lies in libraries "as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead," thereby evincing a hearty contempt for scholastic culture; but nevertheless avowing a stern determination to:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">It is fair to presume that this "song of curses," should it ever come to be sung, will be "shrill," and loud, not to say foul and abusive. Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> is master of the art.</p>

                        <span class="tei_l">The captain on the quarter-deck, coldly giving his <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>orders through a countenance white as a sheet;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Near by, the corpse of the child that served in the <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>cabin,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">The dead face of an old salt, with long white hair and <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>carefully curled whiskers;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">The flames, spite of all that could be done, flickering <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>aloft and below,</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>soothe of waves,</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>his saw,</span>

         <p class="tei_p">We infer that this is not the last of Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ALT</span> W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span>. In point of fact, he gravely tells us that he is "around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless and can never be shaken away;" he sings "from the irresistible impulses of me;" purposes to make "the Poem of the New World;" and "invites defiance to make himself superseded," avowing his cheerful willingness to be "trod under foot, if it might only be the soil of superior poems,"—from which latter confession it is clear that he regards himself as the fertilizing agent of American Poetry; perhaps all the better for fertilizing purposes that the rains and snows of a rough life have caused it to fester in a premature and unwholesome decay.</p>
