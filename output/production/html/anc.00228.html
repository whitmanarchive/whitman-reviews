         <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman's new book, "Specimen Days and Collect" is a literary curiosity made up of extracts from journals and diaries of different years; disjointed bits of criticism, argument, reminiscence, description and speculation, with comments upon persons, events and things; fragments of essays and correspondence; scraps written for newspapers; samples from his commonplace book, and what is quite as interesting as anything else, a brief biography of himself. Added to this, in a second part of the book, are "Democratic Vistas," the long essay written for one of the reviews some years ago; the long preface to the first edition of "Leaves of Grass," published in 1855; "Poetry Today in America," "The Poetry of the Future," and "A Memorandum of a Venture." An appendix contains several stories written in the author's youth, and his two first attempts at poetry. There is no trace or suggestion in its pages of what caused his volume of poems to be read out of decent society. The first part of the volume is mostly given up to war reminiscences, and is full of interest. [Published by Rees, Welsh &amp; Co., Philadelphia.</p>
