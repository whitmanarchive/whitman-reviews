         <p class="tei_p">Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> has strong aspirations toward poetry, but he is wanting entirely in the qualities that P<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">RAED</span>
            <a href="n1" class="internal_link"/> possessed in such large measure. He has no ear, no sense of the melody of verse. His poems only differ from prose in the lines being cut into length, instead of continuously pointed. As prose, they must be gauged by the sense they contain, the mechanism of verse being either despised by, or out of the reach of the writer. Considered as prose, then, we find in them a poverty of thought, paraded forth with a hubbub of stray words, and accompanied with a vehement self-assertion in the author, that betrays an absence of true and calm confidence in himself and his impulses. Mr. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> has fortunately better claims on the gratitude of his countrymen than any he will ever derive from his vocation as a poet. What a man <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">does</span>, is of far greater consequence than what he <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">says</span> or <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">prints</span>, and his devotion to the most painful of duties in the hospitals at Washington during the war, will confer honor on his  memory when <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> are withered and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum Taps</span> have ceased to vibrate.</p>
