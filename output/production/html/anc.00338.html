We can only say that these <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> are fully worthy to be put on a level with that heap of rubbish called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fern Leaves</span>, by F<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ANNY</span> F<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ERN</span>, and similarly "green stuff."
