                <span class="tei_l">Look here, Walt Whitman, what made you write this book, these Leaves of Grass, full of good thoughts, bad thoughts, naughty thoughts, noble thoughts.</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">Ideas politic, impolitic, incomprehensible, insane, inexpressive, impure, invigorating, infuscatable, and infoliate.</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">Did you do it to make pennies, dimes, dollars, eagles, spondulics, rhino,</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">That Walt Whitman—human Walt, might row, ride, riot, regale, recuperate, refocilate—</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">At Hull, Hingham, Nahant, Newport, Rye, Niagara, Shirley, Long Island, Cohasset, Bergen Point, Cape May, or the Mountains called White?</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">Perhaps you did, but then again perhaps you didn’t, for the didn’t is resumptive in this world.</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">And you are anti-resumptive, reticular, responsive and restringent.</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">You’ve made a book, it can’t be rubbed out for it is a fact.</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">Rub out the stars, Declaration of Independence, habeas corpus, magna charta, squatter sovereignty, little Giant, old Abe.</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">Rub out sun, moon, clouds, streams, Board of Aldermen, Japanese Embassy, lapstreak, shell, canoe,</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">Rub out Boston Common, Battery, Girard College, Old Man of the Mountain, Franklin street, horse railroads, Baltimore Convention,</span>
                
                <span class="tei_l">But rub out Leaves of Grass—456 pages, electro-typed, beautiful print, fine type, elegant binding, seemly, comely, white paper—published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge,—it cannot be did.</span>
