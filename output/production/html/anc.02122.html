   <hr/><div class="notes"><h3 span="notes_title">Notes</h3><p id="n1">1. The review misidentifies the title of this work. While the words "Walt Whitman's American Institute Poem" appear on both the volume's cover and one of its two title pages, the words are a secondary title or sub-title; the work's main title, and the one that appears most prominently on the cover, is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">After All, Not to Create Only</span>. Whitman wrote the poem following a request by the Committee on Invitations of the American Institute to deliver an original poem at the opening of the Institute's 40th Annual Exhibition in New York in 1871. It first appeared concurrently in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Commercial Advertiser</span> and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Evening Post</span> on September 7, 1871. It was then published as a stand-alone volume by Roberts Brothers in Boston in late 1871. It is this bound volume that is being reviewed here. Whitman would later retitle the poem "Song of the Exposition" and include it in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> (1876) and in the 1881-82 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.
