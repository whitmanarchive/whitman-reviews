         <p class="tei_p">Opening this book has been to us a revelation. Reading it has yielded us exquisite pleasure. The remembrance of it sweetens life. Echoes from it haunt us in the thick of our occupations, 'under the shade of melancholy boughs,' in the throng of the streets, at our meals, in the midst of our  conversations, anywhere, everywhere, under the likeliest and the unlikeliest circumstances. Before  the volume now under notice came into our hands, the name of Walt Whitman was certainly known  to us, but that was all. Now that we have read these selections—observe, these <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">selections</span>—from his  'Chants Democratic,' from his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum Taps</span>, from his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, from his 'Songs of Parting,' we  have learnt to love that name of his, it has become to us a synonym of pleasure, suggestive of  thoughts, emotions, aspirations, expressed as in a new language, and, once so expressed, never afterwards to be altogether forgotten. To William Michael Rossetti, as the selecter of these poems,  we are not simply, in old-fashioned phrase, beholden, we are not merely in courtlier terms his most obedient, we are his very gratefully, and that, moreover, in heartfelt truthfulness. Already in the columns of the clever but now dead and gone <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chronicle</span>, under date 6th July, 1867, the editor of this  henceforth to us cherished volume of Walt Whitman's Poems had sounded the trumpet of admiration  in praise of that particular poet of America. Here, however, he has made good, in every sense, his high, and, as it might have seemed to some, extravagant commendations. Of the justice of the estimate thus enunciated, these poems yield absolute demonstration. Apart from the selection now given to us by Mr Rossetti, we are desirous that it should be understood at once, however, by our readers, that we know nothing whatever of the writings of Walt Whitman. This we would especially premise. And for a sufficient reason. According to a very general rumour even over here in England, according to the showing of even so enthusiastic an appreciator of his genius as Mr Rossetti has (happily for us all) shown himself to be—Walt Whitman has written things that his own most ardent admirers would willingly let die. Yet, of all this, the volume now in our hand, here submitted to our consideration, bears not a particle of evidence. The leering satyrs have been scared away from among the beautiful umbrage. The dregs lurk no longer in the limpid draught placed at our lips. We can quaff without a qualm. There is no canker in the rose-wreath as it is thus brought within our reach—it is all fragrance and dripping with dew. Not a taint is here, in bloom, or  foliage, or fruit. The very atmosphere investing these poems is all purity, like the breath of morning. And yet—though we never should have conjectured as much from these poems themselves—the Collective Writings of Walt Whitman must indubitably be tainted, flawed, polluted—and that, too, with a taint, a flaw, a pollution in no conceivable way to be extenuated. Mr Rossetti himself sets forth in regard to the incriminated poems (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> of which he has carefully omitted in the process of making his selection) not one word, not one hint of extenuation. He says, indeed, that he considers 'that most of them would be much better away.' And, whatever else can be said of the editor of the present volume as a critic of poetic literature, it certainly cannot be said of him that he is a purist. 'Indecencies, improprieties, deforming erudities' there are, he tells us, scattered, it may even be abundantly scattered, here and there, over the Writings of Walt Whitman. Such they are acknowledged to be, in so many words, even by the critic thanks to whose judicious hands those damning blemishes have been discarded. Of their existence at all, we only know, now, by their own evil reputation. They themselves are not here. Nevertheless this selection is in no respect what we should call, in the ordinary acceptation of the words, an Expurgated Edition. There is here no emasculation. The poems that are given are given in their entirety. Mere parts have been nowhere selected. Abbreviations, elisions, excisions, the Editor has shrunk from as from impertinences. He has done his task well and wisely. And yet, task it can hardly be called—true labour of love as it has been (and no wonder) throughout. Although containing within it 'a little less,' we are told 'that  [sic] half the entire bulk of Whitman's poetry,' this one volume affords a comprehensive view of the writer's genius in its integrity. It is no broken gem that is here placed in our hands for examination, but—'one entire and perfect chrysolite.' Before commenting upon Walt Whitman's poetical productions, however, so far as those are here brought within our survey, a word or two as to the man himself. Abraham Lincoln's exclamation on seeing him was—'Well, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">he</span> looks like a man!' Nor can that exclamation be wondered at when one comes to sum up his characteristics. Lofty in stature, admirably well proportioned, of vigorous strength, of abounding health—forty-nine years of age on the last day of next month—his eyes of a light blue, his complexion florid, his beard fleecy and flowing, but already quite grey—cheerful and masculine in appearance—having a predilection for the society of common people—intensely fond of fine music, and with a great natural taste for works of art—absolutely indifferent 'as to either praise or blame of what he writes'—such, in brief, is Walt Whitman. Born on the 31st of May, 1819, at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, in the state of New York, somewhere about thirty miles from the great American capital and outport—he is but now in the prime or meridian of his manhood, though already old-looking in spite of his health, of his wholesome out-door life, his temperate habits, and his vigorous constitution. A schoolboy up to thirteen, afterwards a compositor, then a country teacher, then a press writer, then a newspaper editor, then a master printer, then (like his father) a carpenter and builder, then, throughout the Great Civil War, to the Northern Army, what Miss Nightingale was to the British Army at Scutari throughout the War in the Crimea.<a href="n1" class="internal_link"/> And, yet all along, and at last wholly and solely, what he is now for the rest of his days—a Poet. Before considering him as such, it is but justice to remark of him in his capacity as a practical philanthropist when attending the poor soldiers all through that tremendous struggle between North and South, between the Federals and the Confederates in America, that 'It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded.' Honour, therefore, to the brave, true heart, if only in remembrance of that one recorded fact in his history—a fact evidencing that Walt Whitman not only 'looks' but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">acts</span> 'like a man.' Turning our glance, however, from the man himself to his productions, to those Poems of his which have been here selected for us from his 'Songs of Parting,' his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum Taps</span>, and so on—one peculiarity is at once especially noticeable in regard to them, and that is their startling, intense, and absolute originality. In their manner, they are unlike any other poems that have ever previously made their appearance. As a rule, they are rhymeless. But, always, always they are rhythmical, and yet rhythmical after a manner peculiarly and exceptionally their own. The lines are of any length—sometimes abbreviated to a little more than a monosyllable—occasionally running out to the extent of half-a-dozen alexandrines. Now standing, as one might say, on one foot, and that a-tip-toe—now running along upon as many feet as those of a centipede. But—with all this whimsicality and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">abandon</span> of manner, with all this wild defiance of the hitherto dominant laws of poetical, and, for that matter even at times of rhetorical, construction—O the charm, the grace, the tenderness, the pathos, the abounding and captivating beauties scattered broadcast, with a lavish hand, with an affluent fancy, with the royal prodigality of genius, over these pages of true poetry! Nor can the daring originality thus manifested by Walt Whitman in the mere manner of his composition be regarded as so wholly unexampled. As has been admirably well asked—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Flinging to the winds of heaven all the precedents of literature, this new poet of the New World, a poet intensely <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sui generis</span>, one racy of the soil from which he has sprung, carves out his own way with a pen as trenchant as an axe, and goes upon that way of his rejoicing. About the only one rhymed passage in the whole of this otherwise quite rhymeless volume of poetry, is the opening of the song in celebration of the broad-axe in the 'Chants Democratic.' And, having but just now—in total forgetfulness at the moment, alike of that especial passage and of that particular song—likened Walt Whitman's pen, in the trenchant sweep of it, to an axe, such as it might be seen gleaming and crashing when wielded in the grip of a backwoodsman of thews and sinews like his own—upon our sudden remembrance immediately afterwards of his own words, the simile appears more than ever most appropriate. For, thus it is that Walt Whitman, in his 'Song of the Broad Axe,' apostrophises that—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">A pen no less potent, keen, piercing, than such a broad axe, 'to be leaned and to lean on,' resting the grass [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>] amid and upon'—is, most assuredly, for us the pen of Walt Whitman. Otherwise than in one fragmentary instance like the foregoing, the book is, as we have said, altogether rhymeless. Wonderfully rhythmical throughout, though in lines of the most oddly varying lengths, the poems of Walt Whitman—when the reader has once passed the Rubicon—exercise over  that initiated reader's mind a potent and irresistible fascination. The Rubicon must be passed, however, as a preliminary, as the first and all-essential preliminary of initiation. Meaning by that, simply, that any one coming to the examination of Walt Whitman's poems with a view to their complete appreciation, must begin by, we won't say taking this and that for granted, we won't even say by making such and such allowances, for, so  expressing ourselves, we might seem to be slighting the high inherent claims to respect of a great original writer, such as Walt Whitman: instead of that we will say then simply—that the all-essential preliminary we are alluding to is one purely of concession. Concede to Whitman the fashion of his verse—concede to him his terse but never bald realism—concede to him his exotic verbiage, his coinage of words occasionally, with a daring disregard alike of the laws of syntax and of philology—and the spell of the magician is felt at once and for ever! We are within the circle of his poetic incantations! He 'hath his will' thenceforth—as he lists—at his own pleasure over our hearts, our emotions, our imaginations. As exemplars, to begin with, of his magical power in mere word-painting—take almost haphazard a single line or verse picked out here and there from the midst of his descriptions:—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">It were idle, however, attempting to afford the reader any adequate notion of these poems as a symmetrical whole, through mere fragmentary or incidental quotations like those to which a reviewer is necessarily restricted. It would be  worse than the proffering of the specimen-brick by the house-vendor in Hierocles—it would be the production of a handful of splinters chipped off the Apollo Belvidere<a href="n2" class="internal_link"/>, or of a stray finger torn from the Venus de Medici.<a href="n3" class="internal_link"/> Whitman's Poems—as is the case with every true work of art—must be viewed each in its entirety before there can be any hope whatever of their accurate appreciation. So regarded, they cannot fail by any possibility, as we conceive, to win the admiration to which they are so signally entitled. After this fashion alone—that is to say at once, searchingly and comprehensively—ought at any time to be examined, that noble apostrophe, beginning at page 310, To Death, that profound and heart-penetrating epitome of Human Life, commencing at page 356, that no less effective and affecting poem upon Night and Death which opens at page 266, but above all the magnificent Nocturn upon the Death of President Lincoln beginning at page 301, and, what is to our mind even finer than that, the exquisitely pathetic and pre-eminently beautiful celebration by Walt Whitman of the first revelation to himself of his own powers and future path in life as a poet, when, as a little barefooted child, he stood upon the sea-shore one evening and far on into the night, listening to the lamentations of the song-bird bereaved of its mate, himself drowned in tears as he listened—standing, there, entranced in the  moonlight drinking in the music of that delicate and tender death-chant! Never before was the song of a bird so put into human language—never before was the rapturous anguish of the poetic summons so articulated. It is Béranger's<a href="n4" class="internal_link"/>

         <p class="tei_p">And now that Whitman has sung (and is still, for that matter, happily singing in the midst of us) in obedience to the holy mandate by which every true poet is at the outset made aware of his vocation, he has as profound a sense of the reality of that summons, and of the consequent permanence or security of his reputation as a Poet, as ever Horace had when proudly forecasting his own poetic immortality. Assuming to himself at once his right position in English Literature, he has even, as it happens, like almost all the more remarkable poets in our language, selected, unconsciously it may be, but unmistakably his own special emblem! Henceforth, as it seems to us, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his</span> inalienably and no other's! A floral emblem to be worn by him from this time forth as conspicuously as the sprig of bloom fastened of old on the helmet of the first Plantaganet.<a href="n5" class="internal_link"/> In this, as we have just now intimated, it is with him, as it has been before him with his compeer and his congeners, the majority of the great poets in our language. Has not Moore<a href="n6" class="internal_link"/>, for example, in this way taken to himself for ever as his the shamrock—and Scott<a href="n7" class="internal_link"/> the purpling heather—and Campbell<a href="n8" class="internal_link"/> the red velvet strings of love-lies-bleeding? Has not Keats his sprig of basil<a href="n9" class="internal_link"/>—and Blair<a href="n10" class="internal_link"/> his branch of funereal yew—and Chatterton<a href="n11" class="internal_link"/> his trail of lamenting willow? But that Burns,<a href="n12" class="internal_link"/> again, according [to] his own showing, was endowed by his Muse (the Muse of Scotland) with the glistening bough of the holly, he might perchance have contested with Dan Chaucer<a href="n13" class="internal_link"/> the latter's now undisputed right to the possession as his of the darling blossom of the daisy.<a href="n14" class="internal_link"/> As indubitably, moreover, as the daisy belongs to Chaucer and the holly to Burns—so has Shelley assumed to himself the sensitive plant, and Wordsworth the little celandine and the daffodils,<a href="n15" class="internal_link"/> and Cowper<a href="n16" class="internal_link"/> the rose and the water lily, and Leigh Hunt<a href="n17" class="internal_link"/> the flowering  branch of May, and Tennyson the gorgeous blossom of the passion flower, if only by right of the 'splendid tear' shed upon it at the garden porch in 'Maud,'<a href="n18" class="internal_link"/> and Milton 'the yellow cowslip and the pale primrose,' and Shakespeare, for that matter, almost every bloom of the parterre or of the wilderness. And, as it has been with those, so it is now and henceforth with this true American Poet Walt Whitman, who has made the lilac—the fragrant, blueish-pink blossoms of the lilac—his own completely. Turning the leaves of these poems, the reader may say before the book is closed as the Poet himself says or rather sings with a sort of rapture—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">For it blossoms, and breathes forth its haunting perfume, and verdantly unfolds its delicate heart-shaped leaves, again and again, all through these pages—more especially in the great Nocturn on the Death of President Lincoln. And so, with the fragrance of the lilacs in our nostrils, and with the song of the lamenting bird in our ears, and with the thought in our hearts of the manly poet himself going his sickening rounds in the ghastly hospitals, all through the great American War, accompanied, as he went down the wards, by his attendant, bearing sponge, and pail, and lint, and ointment, for the cleansing and the binding up of many loathsome wounds, we close this beautiful volume with a renewal of our grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Rossetti, and with a benison to Walt Whitman.</p>
