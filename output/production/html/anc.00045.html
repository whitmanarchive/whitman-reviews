         <p class="tei_p">E<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">VERY ONE RECOLLECTS THE STORY</span> of the Scotch dramatic author who, when Garrick assured him his genius lay neither for comedy nor tragedy, asked him "Where the de'il it did lie?" Now Mr. Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass" puzzle us nearly as much as the Scotsman's query did the great actor. Are we criticising in these "Leaves" prose or poetry? or rather something of an epicene gender, which unites in itself the bad qualities of both one and the other? So far as our perusal of the handsome volume before us has extended—and we must admit that nothing can be more tasteful than its paper and typography—we have scarcely been able to find a single consecutive sentence or expression out of which a meaning can be cudgelled. Taking an odd line here and there, and sometimes even as many as half a dozen, we can extract some hazy nonsense out of them; but what they have to do with those which go before or follow, or why they should be styled "Chants Democratic," or "A Leaf of Faces," or "Calamus," or anything else but "sheer nonsense," we have in vain tried to find out. Nor are we, that we know of, dealing with the productions of a lunatic. Mr. Walt Whitman is sane enough to do the poetry for an American newspaper or two: from whose columns these Leaves are reprints. In this degenerate land of Britain the only persons who nowadays keep a poet are, we believe, the members of an eminent Jewish clothing firm; and though we do not profess to be well versed in the lays of the bard in question, our impression is that they are quite as musical, and at least ten times as intelligible, as these "Leaves of Grass". After all, a horrible idea strikes us that our native land is not entirely guiltless of the paternity of this production. Can it be possible that Mr. Tupper's "Proverbial Philosophy"<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a> has inspired Mr. Walt Whitman with the idea of his Leaves? We have most of us probably heard and read of persons who solved mathematical problems or composed poetry while asleep; and we think it just possible that the author of "Proverbial Philosophy" may unconsciously, while suffering from a fit of the nightmare, have had something to do with the composition of these American Leaves. At least we trace in them some wild fantastic resemblance to his style; such as to make us pretty sure that Mr. Whitman has occasionally "tasted the simple store and rested one soothing hour" with the English poetaster whose words we quote.</p> 

         <p class="tei_p">We give the five opening paragraphs or stanzas of a lucubration headed simply "Walt Whitman."</p>

         <p class="tei_p">Now we assure our readers that these "belched words," to speak <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">à la</span> Walt Whitman, are a perfectly fair, honest specimen of the four hundred and fifty-six pages of the volume before us.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">One of the most curious whims of Mr. Walt Whitman is to give his readers from time to time inventories of the various component parts of some thing or person. Thus (in pages 300-2) we might for a brief moment fancy ourselves poring over a manual of surgery. The mention of the word "body" enables him to write down about one hundred and fifty different items which belong, or may be supposed by poetical licence to belong, to the human form divine. Some of the terms, as "neck-slue," "man-balls," "inward and outward rounds," "the flex of the mouth," are to us rather vague; and we scarcely wonder at their exciting "the curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of his own body or another person's body." So again we have lists, extending over more than a page, or an iron-monger's and carpenter's shop or store, &amp;c. &amp;c., interspersed with such lyric strophes as the following:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">There are some other specimens of Mr. Walt Whitman's muse—for we have now discovered that this amazing rubbish is meant for poetry—which we had rather not quote, for decency's sake; and we fancy our readers will by this time one and all be inclined to cry, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ohe jam satis!</span> Nevertheless we have not altogether wasted their time. They ought to know that this pure unmitigated trash is read and admired by not a few persons in America; and that what would go far in England to stamp its inditer as a lunatic has earned in America for its writer a poet's crown.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">says Virgil's modest swain. Not so, however, with Walt Whitman. He tells us many times over that he is a son of song; and that the "daughter of the lands" (which we suppose means America) has been "waiting for a poet with a flowing mouth and indicative hand"—a vision realised doubtless in himself.</p>
 
         <p class="tei_p">We shall conclude with saying that one of the most curious traits of this volume is the crazy earnestness with which the writer believes in his own poetical infallibility. He is not only a poet, but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the</span> poet; not only a teacher, but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the</span> teacher. To be sure, it follows that if Mr. Walt Whitman really be a poet, and if the contents of this book really be poetry, what Shakespeare and Milton have written must be styled by some new name. Sense, grammar, and metre are but very minor parts in the composition of poetry; but nevertheless, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pace</span> Walt Whitman, poetry cannot exist without this humble triad.</p>
