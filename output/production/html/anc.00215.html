         <p class="tei_p">When James R. Osgood &amp; Co., of Boston, concluded to bring out a revised and enlarged edition of W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ALT</span> W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span>'s "Leaves of Grass," they did the best thing possible for American literature, and performed an act of justice towards the most thoroughly original of American bards. W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ALT</span> W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> is in himself—and in his book, which is himself—the soul of the new and generous continent. He has its asserting egotism, its crude force, its prolific and bounteous vitality. He has the abounding hospitality, the inspiriting positivism of a people that have girdled the forests and chained the mountains and linked to the respectable traditions of a dead past the vital energies of the living present, and who see in the future they shall conquer, the fulfillment of their dearest prophecies and their divinest expectations.</p>
	
         <p class="tei_p">Reading carefully the nearly three hundred pages of "Leaves of Grass" the student, both of literature and of humanity, can but wonder at the strange power that manifests itself in every paragraph. They may criticise the form of expression, may question the taste of certain passages, but the overlying grace of the poet and the underlying spirit of the philanthropist animate every part. Here is the vigor and splendor that have called forth the admiration of an E<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">MERSON</span>, a L<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ONGFELLOW</span> and a T<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ENNYSON</span>. It is the largeness and vitality of the primal man—the gigantic and multiplied possibilities of a continent of vast lakes and praries, and rivers and mountains and far-reaching, fertile plains. The effeminate and hot-house reader has no need of its pages. As well could he exchange his satin-covered and rose-scented couch for a bed among the pine boughs of the Sierras. Its living imagery and masterly action is to them both coarse and crude. This Elijah in the wilderness, with his coarse vesture and fiery self-assertion, is quite as much an object of scorn to the dainty esthetes as was the old prophet to the college boys who shouted, "Go up thou bald head!" But the new bard is a prophet too, and as such is willing to wait the slow appreciation that comes to the forerunner in any line. Nearing the conclusion of his volume he says:—</p>

He is the poet of powerful figures, and there is nothing outside of H<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">OMER</span> and the Bible that equals the splendor of his imagery or the elevation of an occasional passage. The thirty-six pages of military verse under the heading "Drum Taps" contain matchless descriptions of scenes of camp and battle, unequalled by those of any modern writer. "Autumn Rivulets" and "From Noon to Starry Night" are full of indescribable flights. Quoting from the closing poem again, "So Long," the poet prophesies of what shall come after him:</p>

         <p class="tei_p">After all that has been written it is scarcely necessary for us to add that while there are passages in "Leaves of Grass" that for the sake of the immature and casual reader we would gladly obliterate, yet as a sign of the time when a distinctively American school of literature shall arise, vigorous, wholesome, pure, breezy as the praries and lofty as the Sierras, we welcome W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ALT</span> W<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HITMAN</span> and his book. It is a splendid protest against the fine spun and sickly effeminacy of the A<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">MANDA</span> M<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ATILDA</span>
            <a href="n1" class="internal_link"/> poetry of the American magazine. It is very strong meat but good for vigorous digestion. "Camerado," we return your kiss. Though "disembodied, triumphant, dead," you will dwell forever in the epic of democracy.</p>
