         <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman's new publishers, Rees, Welsh &amp; Co of Philadelphia, are evidently cheap sensationalists, quite unfit to issue a great work like "Leaves of Grass." It's to be regretted that Whitman had not the patience to wait for some firm of consequence to take up the task Osgood feebly laid down. The Philadelphia firm advertise in this fashion in the Philadelphia Press:—</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The Critic justly says that "this is a worse blow than that dealt by the Massachusetts Dogberry." These fellows are apparently gamins out of their place. Nothing could be more vulgar than their adoption of "nigger minstrel" slang for so noble a work, and it can only be explained by supposing that they take Anthony Comstock's ignorant estimate of the "Leaves of Grass" for gospel, and count on the patronage of the obscene.<a href="#n1"><sup class="footnote_sup_link" id="ref_r1">1</sup></a> This seems a great pity, but perhaps it is not so, for it may falsely attract to Whitman through their meaner appetites a class of readers who need to learn his great lessons.

         <p class="tei_p">This must be read, as it is written, in the grand manner, and the reader who does not realize that his guide casts behind him the centuries and exhorts him to a new lookout into eternity had better read no more. There has been no more magnificent attitude of command taken than Whitman takes in these utterances, and sustains in almost all that he has written. The trivial person has nothing whatever to do with Whitman.</p>
